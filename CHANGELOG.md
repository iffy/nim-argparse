# v4.0.2 - 2024-08-16

- **FIX:** Internal: add missing cast to `{.nimcall.}` to move beyond things deprecated since Nim 0.18

# v4.0.1 - 2022-11-28

- **FIX:** Changed an internal invocation of `do:` to `do ():` to satisfy [RFC 486](https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/486)

# v4.0.0 - 2022-11-17

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** You can now use hyphens in both `command("...")` and `arg("...")` names. ([#83](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/83))

# v3.0.1 - 2022-11-11

- **FIX:** Added a `.help` field to `ShortCircuit` errors so that you can get subcommand help within an exception handler ([#62](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/62))

# v3.0.0 - 2022-01-31

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** No longer export `macros` when importing `argparse`. Fixes [#73](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/73)

# v2.1.0 - 2022-01-27

- **NEW:** Parse result objects will now have a `OPTION_opt` attribute that is an `Option[string]`. This can be used to inspect if the option was actually given rather than blank. ([#68](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/68))
- **FIX:** When `required=true` for an option, passing a value via environment variable now fulfills the requirement. ([#67](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/67))
- **FIX:** Fix deprecation warning: use `delete(s, first..last)`; delete is deprecated ([#69](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/69))

# v2.0.1 - 2021-07-13

- **FIX:** Removed program name from default subcommand help text
- **FIX:** Restore ability to call `parse()` without args ([#64](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/64))

# v2.0.0 - 2020-12-03

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Calling `parse()` with `-h`/`--help` flags will now raise a `ShortCircuit` error instead of returning options with the `.help` attribute set.
- **NEW:** Removed `argparse_help` and other shortcircuiting flags from the parser options object since they are no longer accessible anyway.
- **NEW:** You can now access subcommand options with `parse()`. ([#60](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/60))
- **FIX:** Required options no longer override `-h`/`--help` shortcircuitry ([#57](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/57))
- **FIX:** Fix parsing of options that combine key and value into a single command-line token.

# v1.1.0 - 2020-11-28

- **NEW:** You can now use `--` to stop further flag/option parsing so that remaining command line parameters are considered arguments.
- **NEW:** It's easy now to have the argument help text display the runtime name of the application using the special `{prog}` string within help text.  To get the new runtime name behavior, call `newParser` without a string name. (Fixes [#33](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/33))
- **NEW:** Options can now be marked as required. ([#31](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/31))
- **FIX:** Works with Nim 1.0.x again.
- **FIX:** Support hidden args again.
- **FIX:** Add documentation and examples back.

# v1.0.0 - 2020-11-26

- **FIX:** Better error thrown when an option is lacking a value ([#29](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/29))
- **FIX:** Better error for when args are missing ([#18](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/18))
- **FIX:** You can now pass `-` as a value to args and options ([#40](https://github.com/iffy/nim-argparse/issues/40))

# v0.10.1
